Write a program that asks the user to enter in 2 short sides and then the longest side of a triangle. Determine if it forms a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.  If any of the entries are not integers, the program will not perform the calculation

You may want to review some of the math operations in the file mathOperators.py

Sample:
Enter side a: 3
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 6
That does not form a right triangle

Enter side a: 3
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 5
That is a right triangle

Enter side a: 4
Enter side b: 3.0
Enter side c: 5
